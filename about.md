# About me

![Portrait of Miika Nissi](./media/miika.jpg)

My name is Miika, I'm a software developer and a Linux/UNIX enthusiast located in Queens, New York. I particularly enjoy learning new paradigms of programming languages and finding simple, efficient solutions.

I work as a Software Developer at [Tawasta](https://tawasta.fi/en/). My work revolves around building open source business solutions for Odoo, business management software, using a technology stack of Python, Javascript, XML/SCSS.

When I'm not programming or working with computers, I enjoy lifting weights, reading and being in nature.

## My website

My website's publishing method has migrated from an [automated bash script](https://github.com/miikanissi/blogi), to Emacs Org-mode and now to a [Makefile based static website generator (mblog)](https://github.com/miikanissi/mblog). Throughout these changes my goal has remained the same: to make a simple static blog website, no JavaScript, no excessive CSS, but a distraction free place to share my ideas and guides about technology.
