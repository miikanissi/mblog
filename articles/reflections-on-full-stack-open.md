# Reflections on Full Stack Open

As my last class before graduation I decided to take a [Full Stack Open course](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) by Helsinki University. The course serves as an introduction to modern web application development with JavaScript. The main focus is on building single page applications with [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) that use REST APIs built with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). The course also contains a section on [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), a modern alternative to REST APIs.

The course also covers testing, configuration and environment management, and the use of [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) for storing the applicationâ€™s data. There is also a part on [Docker Containers](https://www.docker.com/), [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) and CI/CD.

The core course consists of 5-14 ETCS credits of which I completed 13 credits (I skipped part 13 - relational databases, as I have plenty of experience on the topic). Each credit corresponds to roughly 27 hours of work totaling 351 hours for my 13 credits, however I ended up spending roughly 200 hours on the course.

## My experience

*I particularly enjoyed the practical aspect of the course* - it explained the best practices of web development and introduced many helpful tools to ease the development such as linters, npm packages and editor plugins. The course also consisted parts on CI/CD and Docker Containers which are tools to ease development and very practical technologies to be accustomed to.

The course had a great natural progression and most exercises were building on top of previous exercises, which meant there were a lot of refactoring and building additional features on top of pre-existing features, which mimics the development process in the real world.

A big portion of the course was also focused on writing tests using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)/[React Testing Library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library) to write *unit tests* and using [Cypress](https://cypress.io/) to write *E2E tests*. This was my first time being introduced to E2E testing and I was surprised at how advanced the process was - Cypress is a great testing framework.

I completed the 2021 version of the course in early 2022, which meant some of the material was slightly outdated and used older versions of Node.js and React. In practice this was only a small hurdle as most version changes were well documented and I could find an answer with a quick Google search.

## Afterword

I would recommend the course to anyone with a solid programming background that has little to no experience with React/Node.js and are interested in learning the stack. Overall the course is one of the best free online courses on modern web development.
