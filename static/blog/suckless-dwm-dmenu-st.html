<h1>Suckless dwm, dmenu and st</h1>

<p>I've been a fan of minimalist software for quite a while now and I'm alwasy looking for more simple and reliable technology. Suckless is a community of programmers who have made some great pieces of minimalist software that I recently started using. In this post I want to showcase my setup and some thoughts.</p>

<h2>dwm - a dynamic window manager</h2>

<p><a href="https://dwm.suckless.org/">dwm</a>, like all of suckless software, has no configuration files or options. Everything is hard-coded into the source code. To customize dwm, you need to modify the source code and compile it yourself. There are no binary releases at all.</p>

<p>This process of modifying the source code might be intimidating but due to the community around suckless software there are countless of patches available for different needs. Here is a list of patches I'm currently using for dwm:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/actualfullscreen/">actualfullscreen</a>, allows toggling a window as fullscreen.</li>
<li><a href="https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/alwayscenter/">alwayscenter</a>, all floating windows are centered on spawn.</li>
<li><a href="https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/attachbottom/">attachbottom</a>, new windows are attached to the bottom of the stack instead of top.</li>
<li><a href="https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/autostart/">autostart</a>, run a custom bash script on dwm startup.</li>
<li><a href="https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/colorbar/">colorbar</a>, ability to change the colors of the bar for every element.</li>
<li><a href="https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/hide_vacant_tags/">hide vacant tags</a>, hides all the tags not in use from the bar.</li>
<li><a href="https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/pertag/">pertag</a>, allows each tag to have a different layout.</li>
<li><a href="https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/stacker/">stacker</a>, move windows up/down the stack.</li>
<li><a href="https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/staticstatus/">staticstatus</a>, statusbar only on one monitor.</li>
<li><a href="https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/statuscmd/">statuscmd</a>, ability to have clickable statusbar items.</li>
<li><a href="https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/vanitygaps/">vanitygaps</a>, adds gaps between windows.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/miikanissi/dotfiles/blob/master/.local/src/suckless/dwm/patches/dwm-xrdb-6.2.diff">xrdb</a>, reads colors from <code>~/.Xresources</code> at run time.</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, I have quite a list of extra patches applied to dwm, increasing the lines of code from around 2000 to 2700. I see many of these patches as almost necessary, such as the fullscreen patch or the stacker patch.</p>

<h3>dwmblocks - status bar for dwm</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/torrinfail/dwmblocks">dwmblocks</a> is a modular status bar for dwm. It is not made by suckless but it follows the same spirit of suckless software by being source based and only 200 lines of code.</p>

<p>"Blocks" are shell scripts that output some information. You can then define how often or what signal is needed to run the script. For example I have this script for my clock that runs every 30 seconds outputting the date and time. Clicking the clock opens a terminal with <code>calcurse</code>.</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/sh

case $BUTTON in
        1) setsid -f $TERMINAL -e calcurse ;;
esac
date "+ï—¯ %Y %b %d (%a), %-I:%M%p"
</code></pre>

<h2>dmenu - dynamic menu</h2>

<p><a href="https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/">dmenu</a> is a dynamic menu which allows you to create different prompts. By default dmenu has a basic run prompt to launch applications.</p>

<p>I have also made a few scripts utilizing dmenu such as <a href="https://github.com/miikanissi/dotfiles/blob/master/.local/bin/dman.sh">dman</a>, which allows you to mount/unmount devices, and <a href="https://github.com/miikanissi/dotfiles/blob/master/.local/bin/killprocess.sh">killprocess</a>, which allows you to easily kill unresponsive programs.</p>

<p>Another useful dmenu script I found is <a href="https://github.com/miikanissi/dotfiles/blob/master/.local/bin/passmenu.sh">passmenu</a>. Passmenu allows you to get your passwords from Pass (The Standard UNIX Password Manager). I have made a seperate blog post about Pass <a href="https://miikanissi.com/blog/pass-the-standard-unix-password.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>I also have applied a couple of dmenu patches:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/patches/xresources-alt/">xresources-alt</a>, reads colors from <code>~/.Xresources</code>.</li>
<li><a href="https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/patches/password/">password</a>, allows dmenu to hide keyboard input as dots with the option <code>-P</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>st - simple terminal</h2>

<p>You'd think finding a good terminal emulator that is fast and simple would be easy. I have tried xterm, urxvt, alacritty, kitty and so on, but they either lack basic features or are too slow and complicated for no reason. However <a href="https://st.suckless.org/">st</a> is a simple terminal emulator for X that works great with a few extra patches.</p>

<p>The patches I have applied are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://st.suckless.org/patches/bold-is-not-bright/">bold is not bright</a>, renders bold font with same color as regular font.</li>
<li><a href="https://st.suckless.org/patches/scrollback/">scrollback</a>, allows scrolling back and forth on the terminal.</li>
<li><a href="https://st.suckless.org/patches/xresources/">xresources</a>, reads colors and other options from <code>~/.Xresources</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Afterword</h2>

<p>At first I was hesitant to use suckless software because it is source based which made it seem intimidating. But the initial learning curve was worth it. Now I have my own custom builds of these programs and everything works great. I will keep this post updated if I face any problems or I make further changes. So far I'm more than pleased.</p>
